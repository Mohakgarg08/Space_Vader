## Scientific and Graphing Calculator
#### My project is a Scientific and Graphing Calculator that can calculate various problems. It can calculate basic calculations. Find the area of different shapes, graph polynomial and trigonometric expression. 

libraries used:
```
libraries 
  â€¢math
  â€¢Cmath
  â€¢numpy
  â€¢matplotlib
```

#### How the Program Works
##### Importing Libraries
``` python
import math
import cmath
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
This Snippet of code is used to import libraries that will be used in the program. 


##### Main Menu
```python
def main():

  while True:
    print("Enter (1) for Basic Calculations")
    print("Enter (2) for finding the area")
    print("Enter (3) for Graphing Calculator")

    calculator=input("What do you want to do? ")

    if calculator== "1":
      basic()
      break
    elif calculator=="2":
      area()
      break
    elif calculator=="3":
      graphing()
      break
    else:
      print("Invalid Input Please Try Agian")

main()
```
This snippet of code is the start of the program after running the program. This snippet of code is asking the user what they want to do; **Basic Calculator**, **area calculator**, or **Graphing Calculator**. Acordin to the user choice it will jump to that 

#### How to use my program?
- Open your Python program and run the script
- It will ask what the user wants to do basic calculations, finding area, or graphing calculator.
- Then it will ask you inputs according to your choice of what you wanted to do 
It will execute the given problem and return the user the answer or the graph.
